    "Another method to derive vorticity budget is to take curl of the depth-averaged momentum equation. This approach results in a different budget terms than obtained in the method above. Let's derive the equation first and we further discuss the key differences between the approaches.\n",

    "    \\item {\\bf Vorticity of depth-averaged flow}: Take the curl of the depth-averaged momentum equation \\eqref{eq:time-derivative-barotropic}, and the resulting tendency term represents the rate of change of the vorticity of the depth-averaged flow.\n",

    "The first approach introduces a term called JEBAR (joint effect of baroclinicity and relief) into the vorticity equation for the depth averaged velocity \\citep{mertz1992interpretations}. JEBAR is a correction to the vortex-stretching term due to variable topography and does not represent any physical process and as such has led to some  misunderstanding  \\citep{mertz1992interpretations,cane1998utility}. In order to avoid ambiguity, the second approach should be used as JEBAR term does not appear in the vorticity budget. \n",
